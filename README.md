# JS Activity: Refactor Adding Machine to create Simple Calculator
in this activity, you will refactor a simple adding machine to create a siimple calculator that also subtracts, multiplies and divides two numbers based on a `select` menu.

## Instructions
1. Add a `select` menu to the form in `index.html` that has the following options:
    - Add
        - value: `add`
    - Subtract
        - value: `subtract`
    - Multiply
        - value: `multiply`
    - Divide
        - value: `divide`
2. Using conditional statements, perform the correct operation on the two numbers based on the menu option selected.
3. Output the result to the page using an `output` element.
